# FALL2020CSC150Examples
This is a repository for my Fall 2020 Computer Science 1 Students

# Bash Examples:
Currently this Folder contains the following files:
1.) Bash Walkthrough 
	This is a file showing multiple commands that can be done in an intro bash script including:
		a.) Updating a linux system
		b.) Creating Multiple files
		c.) Creating text documents using output from Linux Commands
         	d.) Outputing date from terminal commands to an HTML file.
          
2.) BashIDE
     	 This is a script showing how to use variables and user input to create a simple "IDE" in bash to create custom executables from C files using the GCC tool.

Note: Many of the Bash scripts have a linux_approved tag on them; this is due to writing enivroment differneces between windows and unix systems. When new lines are created windows uses \r whereas Linux uses \n. So the Linux_approved ones are files that have been converted from the windows \r writing.


# C Examples:
Currently this Folder contiains the following files:
1.) Hobbit.c
      This is a C program to demonstrate using While loops as both a way to show passage of time, as well as tool to create algorithms/projections.
